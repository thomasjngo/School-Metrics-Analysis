# School-Metrics-Analysis

Written report is at the beginning of the notebook code. The majority of this code was based off of exercises done in class such as the binning and search for the worst, among others. I had to look up a few things about the groupby and utilizing other functions in conjunction with it on Stackoverflow and in the offical documentation. There were a few things I changed from the starter code because they conflicted with the way I ended up utilizing the dataFrames, but I've tried to keep it as close to the example answers as possible. Code has been commented in those instances.
